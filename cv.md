# Leon Akkerman
## Junior Front-End Developer  
**About Myself**  
My journey to IT started with developing my own game server. To improve game functionality and for the bug fixing I needed JS skills. For the next step I wanted to improve my confidence with SQL database to create and process requests as a scripts. My next goal was to make a game site. I began to learn html, css and React. Each stage has its own roadmap. I was looking for information, read and watched a lot of videos about developing, I tried to find unordinary solutions for complicated tasks. This process was exciting and difficult at the same time.
Soon I realized this is exactly what I wanted to do.
Iâ€™m still in constant search of new technologies and knowledge that let me achieve a successful career in front-end developing.
